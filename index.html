        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>inline CSS: style an element directly in the HTML file. (ex: style attribute.)</li>

          <li>internal CSS style sheet: CSS rules in head section of HTML file using style element.</li>

          <li>external CSS style sheet: most common and preferred way to apply CSS rules; excuted by using the link element in HTML head section to link to CSS file.</li>

          <li>separation of concerns: refers to separating code into different files based on use</li>

          <li>selector: defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>

          <li>declarations: two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. (ex: color = property and blue = value.)</li>

          <li>margin: space outside of the element.</li>

          <li>padding: space inside of the element.</li>

          <li>border: assigns a borber with a certain width and color around element.</li>

          <li>box-shadow: adds shadow effects aroudn elements frame. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>

          <li>CSS box model: HTML element essentially a box. each box consists of margins, border, padding, and content.</li>

          <li>* selector: applies rules to all elements visible on the page.</li>

          <li>can combine 2 or more selectors with a comma. Rather than repeating code we group elements that will share same styling together. This is call Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>

          <li>text-align: a postioning property for text.</li>

          <li>img selector: assigns property values to image element.</li>

          <li>class selector: assigns CSS rules to a class attribute. This allows us to choose what elements gets the style by assigning the class attribute to the element. A class selector is designated by a period preceding it.</li>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>

          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>

          <li>git revert SHA: reverts to previous version.</li>

          <li>git add -a: adds all changes in current working branch to the staging area.</li>

          <li>git commit -m "descriptive message": commits staged content as a new commit snapshot with a message of what was committed.</li>

          <li>git pull origin main: receive version of code from the main branch of the repo.</li>

          <li>git push origin: pushes the changes that are local to the GitHub branch.</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Variable: simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>

          <li>var keyword: declares a variable in JavaScript.</li>

          <li>=: assignment operator that assigns the specific data we want stored in our variable.</li>

          <li>string: all strings are surrounded by "".</li>

          <li>.log(): is a method used to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>

          <li>argument: subject that appears in the () after a method.</li>

          <li>control flow: the order in which a computer executes code in a file. Typically, JavaScript code is executed from top to bottom. However, using conditional statements such as if statements allows us to interrupt control flow.</li>

          <li>if statement: a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using it code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>

          <li>else if statement: used to provide more conditions to an if statement.</li>

          <li>strict equality operator (===): checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>

          <li>If one condition is truthy, the computer will execute the code that we provide between curly brackets. But if the condition is not truthy, the code will not execute, interrupting the control flow.</li>

          <li>array: a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>

          <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index. Using each piece of data's index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array.</li>

          <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1. The indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>

          <li>for loops: uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
