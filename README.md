# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project was built to have a study guide readily available for bootcamp students. With this project one will have a webpage to quickly reference notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The prework study guide is needed due to the fast pace environment of coding bootcamps. 

Through this project I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Then I was able to implement them into this simple webpage that can continue to be built upon by adding more notes to each section.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, refer to each section that contains notes about a certain topic: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. If one were to open the DevTools console, one can see the JavaScript running as it will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
